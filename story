Once upon a time in a forest there lived a Monkey who resided on the berry tree which was on the banks of the river
In the same forest ther lived a Crocodile and his Wife
One day the Crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted Monkey offered him some fruits
The Crocodile came back the nex day for more fruits as he loved them.
As days passed by the Crocodile became good friends
